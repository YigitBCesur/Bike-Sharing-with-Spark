Apache Spark and Scala Certification Training Course for Data Science Master Program

Building a Bicycle Sharing demand forecasting service that combines historical
usage patterns with weather data to forecast the Bicycle rental demand in real-time. To
develop this system, you must first explore the dataset and build a model. Once itâ€™s done
you must persist the model and then on each request run a Spark job to load the model
and make predictions on each Spark Streaming request.
